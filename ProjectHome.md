# Google+ Hangouts Sample and Starter Projects  #

Starting from scratch is always much harder than modifying already working code. There's nothing like seeing features in action before you try to use them.

The Hangout Apps hosted here come in two flavors each with their own intended use.

## Sample Apps ##
This project hosts several sample apps. They showcase features of Hangout Apps. They are intended to inspire you and provide working examples of many of the available APIs in action.

We recommend you start here by creating a Hangouts App project and running these sample apps.

## Starter App ##
This is a single extremely simple and somewhat boring hangouts app. It is not intended to demonstrate the amazing potential hangouts apps but instead it provides turn-key working app and hosting solution from which to start your new project.

  * A simple ~100 line hangouts app in which you click a button to count with your friends
  * Templates of AppEngine configuration files for hosting your new app
  * A README.txt to walk you through deploying and running a Hangouts App

To start with the starter app download the the [zip archive](http://code.google.com/p/google-plus-hangout-samples/downloads/detail?name=starter-app-v2.zip).
